The process of AI visibility is called Illumination. We measure your page's AI readiness as Ai-Lumens a score to illustarte how visible your page is to the AI. The more the lumens the better. 
Tghe process of AI illumination has three pats: Magnification (We make the page's content and most important parts denser and saturated with AI ready content. Magnifying what AI wants to see), Amplification (In this second stage, we amplify the page with meta content, content restrcuturing, adding tags and content in header in right order to amplify the AI visibility, this includes creating description for images, videos, etc.) The third and final stage is Modulation (Modulation refers to strcuturally and visibly changing the page so its more usable for the AI, content dynamically created for different AIs. and users alike)

AiIlluminate = AiMagnify + AiAmplify + AiModulate

We will create a score called AI Lumens, a score that defines how great your visibility is to the AI.
